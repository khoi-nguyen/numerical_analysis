\chapter*{Introduction}%
Scientists across a variety of disciplines translate physical phenomena into mathematical equations.
More often than not,
these equations are too difficult to be solved analytically,
and so one has to recur to \emph{numerical simulation} in order to calculate an approximate solution.
One may think, for example,

These lecture notes cover six important topics in numerical analysis.

\begin{itemize}
    \item 
        \textbf{Floating point arithmetic.} 
        We discuss how numbers are stored on a computer, 
        and present in particular according the~\emph{IEEE 754} standard that is widely accepted today.

    \item 
        \textbf{Solution of linear systems.} 
        Linear systems occur in all branches of science. 
        Important linear systems are those resulting from the discretization of a partial differential equation.
\end{itemize}
