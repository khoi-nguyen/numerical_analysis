\chapter*{Acknowledgments}%
\label{cha:acknowledgements}

I am grateful to Vincent Legat, Tony Leli√®vre, Gabriel Stoltz and Paul Van Dooren for allowing me to draw inspiration from their lectures notes in numerical analysis.
\Cref{cha:solution_of_nonlinear_systems} of these notes follows closely the structure of~\cite[Chapter 3]{VanDooren},
and the presentation of the material in~\cref{cha:interpolation_and_approximation} is based on~\cite{Legat}.
I would also like to thank the following students who found errors and typos in the lecture notes:
Paul Dai, Anthony Francis, Claire Chen, Qinyu Chen, Hannah Ernst, Jinqiao Cheng, Marco He, Wenye Jiang, Steven Li, Yiran Liu, Tingche Lyu, Nikki Tai, Alice Wang, Anita Ye, Linda Zhao and Yuejia Zhang.
