\chapter*{Acknowledgments}%
\label{cha:acknowledgements}

I am grateful to Vincent Legat, Tony Leli√®vre, Gabriel Stoltz and Paul Van Dooren for allowing me to draw inspiration from their lectures notes in numerical analysis.
\Cref{cha:solution_of_nonlinear_systems} of these notes follows closely the structure of~\cite[Chapter 3]{VanDooren},
and the presentation of the material in~\cref{cha:interpolation_and_approximation} is based on~\cite{Legat}.
I would also like to thank the following students who found errors and typos in the lecture notes:
Anthony Francis, Claire Chen, Jinqiao Cheng, Marco He, Wenye Jiang, Tingche Lyu, Nikki Tai, Alice Wang and Anita Ye.
