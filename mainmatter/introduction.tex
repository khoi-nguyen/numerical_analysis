\chapter*{Introduction}%
In a wide variety of scientific disciplines,
notably physics and chemistry,
the phenomena under consideration are well-described by mathematical equations.
More often than not,
these equations are too difficult to be solved analytically,
and so one has to recur to \emph{numerical methods} in order to calculate approximate solutions.
The aim of this course is to carefully study the standard numerical methods for performing the tasks most commonly encountered in applications:
the solution of linear and nonlinear systems of equations,
the solution of eigenvalue problems,
interpolation,
approximation and integration,
Throughout the course, the \texttt{Julia} programming language is employed to exemplify the concepts.

In numerical simulation,
errors arise from four distinct sources:
\begin{itemize}
    \item
        The \emph{modeling error} accounts for the mismatch between reality and the mathematical equations describing it.
        Mathematical equations are generally only an approximation of reality.
    \item
        The \emph{numerical error}
        refers to the error introduced by numerical methods,
        which are generally not exact;
        they only provide approximate solutions to the mathematical equations.
    \item
        The \emph{roundoff errors} come from the fact that
        computers are unable to store the majority of real numbers exactly.
        The number $\pi$, for example,
        contains an infinite amount of digits
\end{itemize}

Let us briefly describe the six topics covered in these lecture notes.
\begin{itemize}
    \item
        \textbf{Floating point arithmetic.}
        In~\cref{cha:rounding_errors},
        we discuss how real numbers are represented and stored on a computer.
        We discuss in particular the~\emph{IEEE 754} standard, which is widely accepted today
        and employed in most programming languages, including \texttt{Julia}.

    \item
        \textbf{Numerical integration.}
        In~\cref{cha:quadrature},
        we study numerical methods for computing definite integrals.
        This chapter is strongly related to the previous one,
        as numerical approximations of integrals are often obtained as the integrals of approximate functions.

    \item
        \textbf{Solution of linear systems.}
        In \cref{cha:solution_of_linear_systems},
        we study the most widely-used numerical methods for solving linear systems.
        Linear systems are ubiquitous is science;
        for example, they arise from the discretization of linear elliptic partial differential equations,
        using for example a finite difference method.
        A subclass of linear systems, in which the matrix on the left-hand side is positive semi-definite,
        arise in the context of optimization:
        if $A \in \real^{n \times n}$ is positive definite and $b \in \real^n$,
        then the unique minimizer of $\frac{1}{2} x^\t A x - b^\t x$ satisfies the linear system $A x = b$.

    \item
        \textbf{Solution of nonlinear equations.}
        Linear systems occur in all branches of science.
        For example, they arise from the discretization of linear elliptic partial differential equations,
        using for example finite difference method.
        A subclass of linear systems, in which the matrix on the left-hand side is positive semi-definite,
        arise in the context of optimization:
        if $A \in \real^{n \times n}$ is positive definite and $b \in \real^n$,
        then the unique minimizer of $\frac{1}{2} x^\t A x - b^\t x$ satisfies the linear system $A x = b$.
\end{itemize}
