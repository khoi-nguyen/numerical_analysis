% Whether or not these inevitable errors are sufficiently small to be neglected in a numerical method
% depends in general on the \emph{numerical stability} of the method.
% A numerical method is said to be \emph{numerically unstable} is small errors are magnified,
% and \emph{numerically stable} otherwise.
% these errors generally need not be a cause worry when they appear in methods that are numerically stables.

\begin{itemize}
    \item 
        In \cref{sec:conditioning},
        we introduce the concept of \emph{conditioning}.
        The condition number associated with a problem provides information on the sensitivity of the solution to errors in the data,
        so it is useful for determining the potential impact of round-off errors.
