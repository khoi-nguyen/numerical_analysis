\section{Discussion and bibliography}%

In this chapter,
we presented direct methods and some of the standard iterative methods for solving linear systems.
We focused particularly on linear systems with a symmetric positive definite matrix.
\Cref{sec:direct_solution_method} is based on~\cite{MR2265914,Vuik}
and \cref{sec:iterative_methods} roughly follows~\cite[Chapter 2]{VanDooren}.
The book~\cite{MR1990645} is a very detailed reference on iterative methods for solving sparse linear systems.
The reference~\cite{shewchuk1994introduction} is an excellent introduction to the conjugate gradient method.
