\chapter{Numerical computation of eigenvalues}%
\label{cha:numerical_computation_of_eigenvalues}

Calculating the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix is a task often encountered in scientific and engineering applications.
Eigenvalue problems naturally arise in quantum physics,
solid mechanics, structural engineering and molecular dynamics,
to name just a few applications.
The aim of this chapter is to present an overview of the standard methods for calculating eigenvalues and eigenvectors numerically.
The rest of this chapter is organized as follows
